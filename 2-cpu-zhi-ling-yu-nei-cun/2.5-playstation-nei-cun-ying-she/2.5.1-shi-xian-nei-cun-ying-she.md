# 2.4.1 实现内存映射

In order to implement the PlayStation memory map in our emulator we will need an interconnect to dispatch the load/store operations to the correct peripheral.

为了在我们的模拟器中实现PlayStation内存映射，我们需要一个互接器来将加载和存储操作分派到正确的外设。

I don't know if the PlayStation really has a hardware interconnect. The CPU could just "broadcast" the read/write operations on the system bus and the peripherals would check the address and only answer if it's for them. However, this design would be inefficient in software: we'd need to iterate over the peripherals for each transaction until we find the correct receiver.

我不知道PlayStation是否真的有硬件互接器。CPU可以在系统总线上“播撒”读/写操作，外设(peripherals)会检查地址是否在他们映射范围内。然而，这种设计在软件方面效率低下：我们需要为每个事务遍历外设，直到找到正确的接收者。

Instead, we're just going to implement a "switchboard" that will match the address to the correct peripheral and forward it there.

相反，我们将实现一个“交换总机”，将地址匹配到正确的外围设备并将其转发到那里。

Since the first thing the emulator will run is the BIOS we'll use it as our first peripheral.\
由于模拟器最先运行BIOS，因此我们将它作为第一个外围设备。
